<h3>Flowers in the Attic</h3>
<p>You won't believe a mother locked up her children in the attic for several years just to inherit her Father's wealth. In an attempt to get rid of them, she adds a portion of rat poison to their meal. the story is based on a novel which I think is super interesting to read.</p>

<h3>Miss Bridgerton</h3>
<p>A group of young girls must keep themselves chaste and find suitors at the age of 18 because of what society expects from them. I totally love the whole British accent used in the movie.</p>
