<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Precious Akintoye and I work as a web developer. 
  I am a Law Graduate who loves to create and manage visually appealing websites that are easy to navigate for end users. 
  I think there's a whole lot yet to be explored in the tech world.
  I am also a very proficient and creative writer with a keen eye for detail as well as an unquenchable thirst for research. 
  I love to work with like-minded people who can share ideas and learn from one another.
